    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Joseph Santay, and I am currently studying at Lewis University.<br>
        I am majoring in Cybersecurity and will get my degree on 12/23/22.<br> 
        I have 5 siblings in total, 2 brothers, 3 sisters. 
    </p>

    <h2>What I Hope To Learn</h2>
    <p>I'm hoping to learn a few different things in this course,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
        <li>How to create a website</li>
        <li>Python and Django</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
    <p>My favorite hobby is playing video games. I grew up playing video games<br>
    all the time and it was really the only way until I started college to interact<br>
    with technology. While I still enjoy video games, my interest has decreased<br>
    over the years, and I don't have as much time to play as I used to.</p>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>A fun fact about me is that I used to be able to<br>
    lift 325lbs on the bench press before I hurt my wrist</p>
